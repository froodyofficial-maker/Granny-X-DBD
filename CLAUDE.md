# Granny x DBD — project notes for Claude

A standalone fan game: Granny as the killer in a Dead by Daylight–style 1v4. It was forked from
**Nightbound** (froodyofficial-maker/Nightbound, a separate game) and cut down to its own identity.
three.js r160, plain ES modules in `public/js/`, bundled with esbuild into single HTML files.

## Hard rules from the owner (froodyofficial-maker)
- **The code lives in the repo froodyofficial-maker/Granny-X-DBD** (public, by the owner's choice).
  Don't turn on GitHub Pages or upload it anywhere else unless the owner asks. Hand builds to the
  owner directly as files (the .exe zip, the .apk, videos). Built files (GrannyDBD.html, exe, apk)
  are not committed: rebuild them with the commands below.
- **Killers: Granny, Grandpa (his own killer since 1.1, no longer an outfit), Slendrina and Angeline (1.3).**
- **Survivors: only Mara, Eli, June and Tomás.**
- **Maps: Granny's House (`granny`) and Granny's Old House (`granny1`).** No other maps.
- Removed for good (don't bring back): ghost traps, all lore, Testing Area, the old intro banner / trailer gate.
  (Sidekicks, the Progress screen, ranks and levelling were removed in 1.0 but the owner asked for them back in 1.4:
  they are in again, in the 1.4 form described below.)
- Bots must never stall. **Falling off the roof of the house is fine: don't add barriers.**
- Don't put the owner's real photo/face on any model.
- Never paste API keys or secrets into chat.

## Layout
- `public/index.html`, `public/css/style.css`, `public/js/*.js` — the game source.
  - `main.js` menus, sessions (HostSession / ClientSession), lobby, store, settings.
  - `sim.js` host-authoritative simulation; `bots.js` bot AI; `rules.js`, `movement.js`.
  - `map.js` + `grannyhouse.js` / `grannygrid.js` the house map (multi-floor levels + stairs, `heightAt`, `levelOf`).
    `buildMap(seed, map)`: `granny1` = Granny's Old House: `buildArena` (5x5 woods cells, ring pushed out by
    `HOUSE1.xs/zs`) with the Granny 1 house (`granny1_map.glb`, converted from the owner's USDZ, underground
    parts dropped). Since 1.2 its ground floor (hall, kitchen, living room, ~150 m2) is walkable through the front
    door (door + locks removed from the model and collision); the rest of the plot stays solid. Collision is
    `granny1grid.js` (measured from the model, no wall thickening so inside doorways stay open; navR 0.24 on this
    map). One generator is placed inside at build time by `placeHouseGen` (deepest spot reachable from the door).
  - `game.js` rendering/input/HUD per frame; `models.js` + `*Glb.js` character models; `world.js` scene.
  - `net.js` online (MQTT relay + self-signalled WebRTC), `snap.js` snapshots, `friends.js`, `awards.js`.
  - `loadscreen.js` the 3D loading screen (1.3: a killer reel in front of Granny's House: each killer steps out
    under a swinging bulb for 5.6 s with a name + powers card; soft light cone, dust, fog; `window.__lsSeek(t)` for shots).
    `showLoading(on, msg, isLite, rendererOf)`; it renders with the game's own renderer; the main loop
    skips the menu/game while it's up; `HostSession.start` is async with a frame yield between steps
    (this fixed the STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION freeze when loading into a match).
  - `progress.js` (1.4) account level, ranks (Ash..Iridescent, IV..I, 4 pips per grade), seasons (`seasonAt`: a new one every
    42 days from 1 Nov 2026, `SEASON` = the current one, 30 tiers x 1000 XP, free + premium track; premium costs
    `PASS_PRICE` 8000 Embers once per season; premium tier 15 = Angeline 'gilded' outfit, 30 = Granny 'longnight'
    (skins with `pass: true, price: -1`, owned only through the pass), every 5th premium tier a level token), `seasonRoll`
    (new season: Embers for each rank, ranks drop one tier, fresh pass; called at startup), character levels (`charLv`,
    `charOf` = `profile.chars[id] = { xp, st }`, `freePoints`, `matchStats`, `trainOne`), `applyMatch` (account XP, season XP,
    rank pips, and the played character's XP). Progress panel = `renderPass()` in main.js (menu button "Progress").
  - `touch.js` phone/tablet controls (joystick left, drag-to-look right, context buttons), `body.touch` CSS.
    Mobile mode (`MOBILE` = touch device or `window.__forceTouch`; `html.mobile`): no keyboard/mouse hint anywhere.
    `touchName(id)` maps keybind ids / 'LMB' / 'RMB' / 'V' to button names (game.js `KL()` / `B()` / `kbd()`),
    `mobileText()` rewrites "Hold G" / "Press R" / "click" in descriptions and feed lines; `.pc-only` is hidden,
    `.touch-word` only shows on mobile; the skill check dial is tappable and VAULT reads HIT! during one.
- `public/models/*.glb` (granny, grandpa, granny_anims, granny_map, granny1_map, slendrina, angeline, granny_bear_trap, spidermom, …), `public/img`, `public/fonts`.
- `tools/build.mjs` → builds **`GrannyDBD.html`** (offline single file, GLBs embedded) and **`index.html`** (web).
- `tools/electron/` Windows app (Electron 33.2.1). `tools/android/` APK build (no Gradle).
- `tools/test/` the headless checks used during development (Playwright + SwiftShader; `ROOT` is /home/user/granny-x-dbd):
  `simtest.mjs <map> <killer> <matches> <minutes>` bot-only matches, prints stall seconds (must be 0);
  `play.mjs <role> <killer> <map> <prefix>` plays a bot match and saves frames; `look.mjs <killer> <map> <prefix>` in-match shots;
  `lsshot.mjs out.png medium [menu.png]` loading screen (uses `window.__lsSeek`); `mobile.mjs` phone-emulated menu/help/HUD
  check (prints any key names left in the HUD); `lobbytest.mjs` 3 players vs a local relay (`node broker.mjs` first:
  aedes@0.51.3 + aedes-server-factory@0.2.1) for public/private lobbies; `angview.mjs` / `rigview.mjs` character poses;
  `rawglb.mjs file.glb prefix` plays a GLB's own clips with plain three.js; `render-devlog.mjs` + `devlog13-page.js` /
  `devlog14-page.js` the devlog banners (in-engine, 2560x1440); `ui14.mjs` Loadout/Store/Progress screenshots;
  `match14.mjs` a 2v8 match as Angeline with the Child (`GM=classic K=granny` to change). simtest takes `MODE=duo` and
  `KID=1`. Playwright resolves through `tools/test/node_modules` -> `$(npm root -g)` (a symlink, not committed: recreate it).
- `server.js` optional LAN server (`node server.js 8090`), `start-*.bat/.sh/.command` launchers.
- `README.md` is still Nightbound's old README (outdated; don't trust it for this game).

## Identity / namespacing (keep separate from Nightbound)
- localStorage prefix `gdbd_` (e.g. `gdbd_settings`, `gdbd_profile`).
- Relay topics `grannydbd/v1/...`, PeerJS prefix `grannydbd-v1-`. `NET_PROTOCOL = 13`, `VERSION = '1.4.0'` (config.js).
- Public lobbies (1.3): the host publishes a retained message on `grannydbd/v1/pub/<4-char stem>` (`H.advertise(info|null)`
  in net.js, refreshed on every lobby change and each 60 s) with an MQTT last will that clears it if the host drops.
  `watchLobbies(cb)` subscribes `grannydbd/v1/pub/+` on every broker; main.js renders the list + Quick Join.
  Visibility is `lobby.vis` ('public'/'private', host toggle in the lobby). Relay-mode (node server.js) rooms are code-only.
- Official Discord: https://discord.gg/WXvAJ2sgVP (`DISCORD` in config.js): menu top-right button and pause menu.
- Electron appId `io.github.froodyofficial.grannyxdbd`. The APK signing keystore (`release.jks`,
  alias `grannyxdbd`) is NOT in the repo: the owner keeps it. Put it in `tools/android/` and set
  `KS_PASS` before building; always sign with the same key so updates install over old versions.

## Gameplay details worth knowing
- Difficulty (`config.js` DIFFICULTY): easy {aim .3, killerSpeed .84, sight 18, reach 2.1},
  normal {react .55, aim .42, killerSpeed .87, sight 22, reach 2.2}, hard unchanged.
- Bot survivors use `SURV_SKILL = { react: .35, skill: .94, great: .2 }` (bots.js).
- Bots: `regions()/regionAt()/nearestIn()` reachability (grid type 1 = blocked, gates passable);
  `goTo` falls back to a direct move when there's no path; flee only to reachable spots, on the
  right floor. Bat Rush gated by `willing(b, D, dt)`; I Hear You rates scaled by difficulty aim.
- Skins: price-0 skins count as owned. `window.__THREE`, `window.__killerSkin`, `window.__cine`
  (film-camera hook called in game.js after updateCamera) exist for trailer capture.
- `game.touch` bypasses pointer lock (touch devices).
- Grandpa (`grandpa`): shotgun (RMB hold/release, act `rush` -> `sim.shotgun`, survivors' `shp` bar: 34 dmg at <=2m
  to 75 at >=14m, so 2 shots down from mid range, 3 point-blank; each hit staggers (boost 0.9s at x0.6 speed)), Bear Trap (R, `S.bears`, `snare`). Model = grandpa.glb via `makeGrannyGlb({grandpa:true})`; his body/gun
  materials are brightened in `AnimRig.material` (the file darkens them to 30%).
- Slendrina (`slendrina`, third person): Haunt (RMB hold shows a ground marker, act `haunt` with x/z ->
  `reachableSpot`, `tele.h`), Cursed Gaze (R, `gaze` timer; survivors looking at her get `cursed`/`curse`,
  `doomed` = next hit downs). Model slendrina.glb (DVUnit, spec-gloss converted to metal-rough).
- Bot watchdogs (bots.js): a survivor still for 2.5s avoids that goal 15s (`b.avoid`), a killer still for 3s
  drops its target/patrol and avoids unreachable hooks/downed (`b.kAvoid`). Carrying killers path round
  dropped pallets; killers avoid one-cell gaps (`grid.narrow`).
- Smarter bots (1.2): survivors treat Grandpa aiming at them (32m, in sight) as a threat and zig-zag (`b.juke`),
  flee Slendrina's gaze and her haunt arrivals, remember ~60% of the traps they see (`b.traps`), and break sideways
  when cornered (`b.cornerT`). Killers weight targets (snared, doomed, heard, low shp); Grandpa strafes at mid range
  while the gun cycles.
- Angeline (`angeline`, third person, 1.3): Yellow Eyes (RMB hold: a 16 m beam from her eyes; 0.5 s in it = `spotted`,
  her next hit downs; `spotT`/`inBeam`), Lullaby (R: survivors within 30 m get `drowsy` 5 s: no running, x0.75 speed).
  Model angeline.glb (CC BY 4.0, "Angeline Unity" by A_Forogotten_Studio; SPEC yaw PI). Her camera sits wider and she fades
  when a wall pulls the camera close. **She is animated in code, not with the file's clips** (they twisted her and stretched
  her arm; the rest pose stood her sleeves up like wings). The file's bind matrices are ~1.8x taller than the mesh:
  `toBindPose` fits that stretch from the mesh's joints, corrects the inverse bind matrices and puts her in the T-pose;
  `animateAngeline` aims bones in parent space (`aimBone`/`turnBone`) from that rest each frame (hanging arms, glide lean,
  float bob, spread arms for Yellow Eyes, wind-up + two-handed lunge, stun flail). Her size is measured in that pose.
- Granny's House floors (1.3): `grannyfloors.js` = per-floor support maps measured from granny_map.glb; nav cells with no
  floor under them are blocked, and `dropFloor` drops anyone who walks off an edge to the floor below. Gen/teammate
  auras are hidden across floors. Bear traps use granny_bear_trap.glb (jaws close on `bearsnap`).
- Character levels and stats (1.4, `CHAR_LEVEL` / `STATS` / `cleanStats` / `statK` in config.js): every character has its own
  level (max 41, XP from matches or `train` with Embers, or a level token from the pass); each level past 1 is a stat point,
  max 10 per stat. Survivor: Agility (+0.8% speed/pt), Mechanic (+2.5% repair and gates), Medic (+3% healing), Grit (+5%
  struggle and unhook). Killer: Stalker (+0.6% speed), Focus (+2.5% faster recharge: the sim shortens any cooldown that was
  just started, `cdPrev`), Brutality (+4% break/kick/pickup/hook), Reach (+1.5% lunge). Players carry `stats` (STATIC in
  snap.js); hooks are in rules.js `speedOf` / `actionTime`, sim.js gen repair, healing and wiggle. Bots have none.
  Loadout shows level, XP bar, points (+/−, reset free), Train and level tokens (`levelHTML` / `bindLevel`).
- Sidekick (1.4): `SIDEKICKS.child` "The Child of Slendrina", killers only, 20,000 Embers in Store > Sidekicks, equipped
  in the killer Loadout (`profile.pets.child`, `profile.killer.pet === 'child'`, sent as `kid: 'child'`). Sim `updateKids`:
  `S.kids` [{id = owner, x, z, fl, sp, yaw, st 0 idle / 1 crawl / 2 shriek, tp}], crawls behind-left of its killer
  (out of the camera's way), catches up out of sight on another floor / far / stuck; a survivor within 11 m in its sight
  -> shriek: revealed 4 s (14 s per survivor), event `kidcry`. Model slendrina_child.glb ("DVloper - Slendrina's Child
  (Official Model)" by danielthesecond, CC BY 4.0; own clips idle/walk/attack/eat...), `makeChild` in grannyGlb.js; game.js
  `updateKids` draws it and fades it near the camera. Bot killers bring it 35% of the time. Portrait: public/img/child.png
  (tools/test/childshot.mjs).
- Two Killers / 2 vs 8 (1.4): `MODES.duo` (killers 2, survivors 8, 6 of 7 generators). Bot killers stop patrolling generators
  once the gates are powered and pace in front of their own gate (`killersOf(S).filter(bot).indexOf(p)`).
- Third-person camera (1.4): besides the collision boxes it ray-casts the house model (`W.glb`, ~15/s) and a point 0.7 m
  lower, so it no longer ends up inside walls/the broken gate that have no collision box.
- HUD perks: four perk diamonds sit top/left/right/bottom (`#perks .diamond:nth-child(4)`).
- Headless bot-only matches (Sim + Bots, no rendering) run ~10 game minutes per second: useful to find stalls.

## Build
```bash
cd tools && npm install && cd ..
node tools/build.mjs            # → GrannyDBD.html + index.html
```
Play/test: `python3 -m http.server 8091` in the project root, open `http://localhost:8091/index.html`.

### Windows .exe (Electron)
```bash
cp GrannyDBD.html tools/electron/app/index.html
cd tools/electron && npm install
npx @electron/packager . GrannyxDBD --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --out=out --overwrite --icon=icon.ico
(cd out && zip -qr ../GrannyxDBD-Windows.zip GrannyxDBD-win32-x64)   # backup: the folder, must be extracted
npx electron-builder --win portable --x64 --prepackaged out/GrannyxDBD-win32-x64 --config builder.json  # → dist/GrannyxDBD.exe
```
The single portable `dist/GrannyxDBD.exe` (with `splash.bmp`) is what the owner uploads: people ran the old .exe
from inside the zip. Without Wine, `--icon` can't be applied by the packager: set icon + version on the packaged exe
before the electron-builder step: `node tools/electron/seticon.mjs out/GrannyxDBD-win32-x64/GrannyxDBD.exe icon.ico 1.3.1`
(resedit + pe-library). The NSIS installer target needs Wine. In practice: package with `--ignore='^/out' --ignore='^/dist'`
(no `--icon`), run seticon, then electron-builder. The owner can't download a bare .exe from the chat: send it zipped
(`zip -9 GrannyxDBD-<ver>-Windows.zip GrannyxDBD.exe`).

`main.js` opens `app/index.html`, maximised, no menu bar, F11/Alt+Enter fullscreen, single instance, logs to
`%APPDATA%\Granny x DBD\log.txt`; repeated GPU/page crashes relaunch it in Safe Graphics mode (software WebGL,
sticky; `--gpu` resets it). External links go to the real browser.

### Android .apk
Uses an Android SDK at `SDK=/home/user/android-sdk` (build-tools 34, platform 34) if present; otherwise Ubuntu's packaged
tools (`apt install aapt dalvik-exchange zipalign apksigner android-sdk-platform-23`: aapt2 + dx + android-23.jar, with
compile-only stubs in `tools/android/stubs/`). dl.google.com is blocked in the cloud sessions, so the apt route is the one
that works there. `KS=/path/to/release.jks` picks the keystore.
```bash
tools/android/build-apk.sh /path/to/GrannyDBD.html     # → tools/android/GrannyxDBD.apk
```
It sets the page viewport to 1280 CSS px (menus fit phones), forces mobile mode (`__forceTouch` + `html.mobile`), compiles `src/` (MainActivity.java,
GameClient.java — a WebView; javac -source 8 against android.jar; d8; zipalign; apksigner).
Bump `VC`/`VN` env vars for a new version.

## Testing in a headless browser (what worked)
- Playwright + Chromium with `--use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader`.
- Seed localStorage (`gdbd_settings`, `gdbd_profile` with `seen` flags) in an init script.
- `window.__nbMqtt = ['ws://localhost:8883']` points online play at a local MQTT-over-WebSocket broker
  (e.g. aedes + aedes-server-factory) for multiplayer tests; `window.__nbNoRTC = true` forces relay-only.
- `window.__nb` exposes `session`, `lobby`, `settings`, `profile`.
- Software rendering is slow: grab frames with `renderer.domElement.toDataURL()` right after
  `game.frame()` instead of page screenshots at high quality.

## Done so far (history)
Granny-only roster and house map; Grandpa outfit; 3D loading screen; load freeze fix; Electron app;
APK with touch controls; smarter bots (no stalls); Game Jolt header/thumbnail/page text using the
owner's GRANNY and DBD logos (no line under them); a 57 s YouTube trailer (v2: tense synthesized
score, re-shot scenes) and a 17 s vertical YouTube Short with a "SHE HEARD YOU." thumbnail.
1.3: Angeline, real Granny bear trap model, Granny's House floating-floor fixes, killer-reel loading screen, sharper
graphics (anisotropy, PCF soft shadows on medium, unsharp mask in PostShader), public/private lobbies + lobby browser,
Discord link, mobile-only controls + APK 1.3.0 (versionCode 13). The 1.3.0 APK was signed with a NEW key (the owner's
release.jks wasn't available), so players uninstall older APKs first; re-sign with release.jks for later updates.
Devlog banner "ANGELINE · SLENDRINA'S MOTHER IS HERE" rendered in-engine.
1.4 (current): character levels + stats, The Child of Slendrina sidekick, Two Killers (2v8), seasons + ranks + season
pass with a premium track, perk HUD fix, camera ray-cast. APK versionCode 15 / 1.4.0 (signed with grannyxdbd-1.3.jks),
Windows app 1.4.0. Devlog banner "LEVEL UP · AND MEET THE CHILD" (tools/test/devlog14-page.js, PAGE=... OUT=... render-devlog.mjs).
1.3.1: Angeline animated in code (see Angeline above); APK versionCode 14 / 1.3.1, Windows app 1.3.1
(config.js `VERSION` still says '1.3.0', NET_PROTOCOL 12: 1.3.0 and 1.3.1 play together). Main branch = latest.

## Where things stand / next steps
- The 1.3.x APKs are signed with a key made in the 1.3 session (`grannyxdbd-1.3.jks`, alias `grannyxdbd`), which was handed
  to the owner as a file together with its password file. For the next APK the owner puts that .jks in `tools/android/` (or
  passes `KS=/path`) and sets `KS_PASS` from the password file, so the update installs over 1.3.x. Never ask for the password
  in chat; if the owner doesn't have the key, a new key means players uninstall first.
- Not yet tested on a real phone (only Chromium phone emulation) and the public lobby list was tested against a local relay,
  not the public brokers.
- Ideas not done: a 1.3 YouTube Short / trailer with Angeline; bump `VERSION` to 1.3.1 next time anything ships.
1.2: Granny's Old House enterable, stronger shotgun, taller Slendrina (1.95m), smarter bots, YouTube Short #2
("SHE'S NOT ALONE ANYMORE.", rendered in-engine, synthesized score).
1.1: Grandpa as his own killer, Slendrina, Granny's Old House, bot stall fixes, portable Windows exe,
devlog thumbnail (rendered in-engine: the three killers at the Granny 1 house's front door).
